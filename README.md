# UFOs
## Project Overview

   This project provides an in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings data. A webpage was developed to allow users to parse and view data in a dynamic table. The filters used to parse the data are listed below. 

- **Filters:** Date, City, State, Country, and Shape
 
## Results

The initial webpage will display at the top of the page a paragraph about UFO Sightings. At the bottom half of the page, you will see on the left, the search criteria column and on the right, a  UFO sightings data in a table format.  
##### To perform a search
 
  1. Populate at least one of the data fields text boxes in the filter search column.

     **To enter a search criteria:** Enter the data in the appropriate field.

        **Note:**  Use the same data format as displayed in the text box or refer to the UFO sighting data table displayed on the right.

##### To enter a new search criterion.
 
 - Hit the web browser's refresh button. 
 

### Summary

   One of the drawbacks of the webpage is that the user must key in  the exact match of the filter data to get the desired filtered table. 

#### Recommendations

1.	Modify the text box to a  drop-down list for each filter criteria. The list will  show all the available data to get an exact match of the filter criteria.
2.	Aside from the drop-down list, the user should also be allowed to key in a wild card character (*)  for each of the filter criteria.
3.	A new search text button to start a new search. The button invokes a function that will display the unfiltered table and clear all the input data entered by the user.
